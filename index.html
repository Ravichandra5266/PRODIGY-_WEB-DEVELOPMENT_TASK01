				<h3> Designed for All Types of Creatives </h3>
				<h3>Apple M1 Pro</h3>
				<p
					>Packed with 33.7 billion transistors, the Apple M1 Pro
					integrates the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O, and more into a
					single system on a chip (SoC). Built with 5nm process
					technology, the Apple M1 Pro delivers the performance you
					need without sacrificing power efficiency. The 10-Core CPU
					features eight performance cores and two high-efficiency
					cores. The 16-Core Neural Engine provides support for
					on-device machine learning acceleration and improved camera
					performance. The M1 Pro offers up to 200 GB/s of memory
					bandwidth as well as support for up to 32GB of unified
					memory. The efficient architecture of M1 Pro means they
					deliver the same level of performance whether MacBook Pro is
					plugged in or using the battery. The M1 Pro also features
					enhanced media engines with dedicated ProRes accelerators
					specifically for pro video processing. With up to a 16-Core
					GPU, the M1 Pro delivers up to 70 percent faster CPU
					performance than the M1.</p

				<h3> 16.2" Liquid Retina XDR Display </h3>
				<p>
					Featuring mini-LED technology, this MacBook Pro houses a
					16.2" Liquid Retina XDR display. Delivering up to 1,000 nits
					of sustained, full-screen brightness, a high 1,600 nits of
					peak brightness, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and a billion
					colors, the Liquid Retina XDR display can handle the extreme
					dynamic range of HDR content, providing detailed shadows,
					brilliant specular highlights, deeper blacks, and vivid
					colors. The display is less than 4 mm thin, which is
					achieved by having seven films and diffusers that mix and
					shape the light efficiently. The oxide thin film transistor
					(TFT) allows pixels to charge twice as fast as before.
				</p>
				<h3> ProMotion - Up to 120 Hz Refresh Rate </h3>
				<p>
					With ProMotion technology, the MacBook Pro automatically
					varies the refresh rate to match the motion of your onscreen
					content. This helps preserve battery life while also making
					tasks feel more fluid and responsive. This means that the
					display can have up to a 120 Hz refresh rate. Video editors
					will also have the option to lock in a refresh rate that is
					optimal for their footage.
				</p>
				<h3> P3 Wide Color Gamut </h3>
				<p
					>The narrow-band LED-powered backlight allows the MacBook
					Pro to represent the P3 wide color gamut for brilliant,
					true-to-life color in photos and videos.</p
				>
				<h3> Storage - Bring Your Whole Studio with You </h3>
				<p
					>The MacBook Pro can be configured with up to 8TB of SSD
					storage so you can take your photo or video libraries with
					you no matter where you're headed. And with superfast
					speeds, massive files load in an instant and pro apps launch
					in a blink. This particular model comes with a 1TB SSD.</p
				>
				<h3>Connectivity </h3>
				<h3>Thunderbolt 4</h3>
				<p
					>Thunderbolt 4 combines ultra-high bandwidth with the
					versatility of the USB Type-C industry standard to create
					one revved-up universal port. It integrates data transfer,
					charging, and video output in a single connector, delivering
					up to 40 Gb/s of throughput for twice the bandwidth of
					Thunderbolt 2. The MacBook Pro is equipped with three ports,
					so you can do all of that from either side. Existing devices
					are easily connected with a cable or adapter. And
					Thunderbolt 4 is reversible, so no matter how you plug in,
					it's always right side up.</p
				>
				<h3> MagSafe 3 </h3>
				<p
					>MagSafe 3 makes connecting a power cable quick and easy
					while also protecting your MacBook Pro. Apple also brings
					fast charging to the MacBook Pro, allowing you to charge up
					to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.</p
				>
				<h3> High-Fidelity Audio </h3>
				<h4> Spatial Sound Speakers and Better Mics </h4>
				<p
					>The MacBook Pro features a high-fidelity six-speaker sound
					system, which has two tweeters for a clearer soundstage as
					well as four force-cancelling woofers, resulting in 80
					percent more bass. The sound system also supports spatial
					audio, providing a three-dimensional audio experience,
					whether you're listening to music or watching a movie in
					Dolby Atmos. Apple also has studio microphones that have a
					lower noise floor, resulting in clear calls as well as voice
					recordings.</p
				>
				<h3> FaceTime </h3>
				<h3> Full HD 1080p FaceTime HD Camera </h3>
				<p
					>Now with a Full HD 1080p FaceTime HD camera, the MacBook
					Pro uses the ISP and Neural Engine in M1 Pro and M1 Max for
					computational video that enhances video quality.</p
				>
				<h3> System Navigation </h3>
				<h3> Keyboard </h3>
				<p
					>Physical function keys are back with the Magic Keyboard on
					the MacBook Pro. Replacing the Touch Bar, the familiar,
					tactile function keys have made their return. There is even
					a wider ESC key.</p
				>
				<h3> Touch ID </h3>
				<p>
					The Touch ID enables fast, easy authentication for secure
					logins and purchases.
				</p>
				<h3> Force Touch Trackpad </h3>
				<h3>
					Speed your workflow with Force click and multi-touch
					gestures.
				</h3>
				<h3> All-Day Battery Life Battery </h3>

				<p>
					From pro workflows to everyday tasks, the MacBook Pro
					delivers power efficiency while still maintaining
					performance. The MacBook Pro can deliver up to 21 hours of
					video playback.
